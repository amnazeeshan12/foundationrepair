<h3 class="" data-start="660" data-end="696">What Causes Foundation Problems?</h3>
<p class="" data-start="698" data-end="861">Foundation problems can result from a variety of factors, many of which are related to soil conditions and moisture levels. Some of the most common causes include:</p>

<ul data-start="863" data-end="1507">
 	<li class="" data-start="863" data-end="1034">
<p class="" data-start="865" data-end="1034"><strong data-start="865" data-end="882">Soil movement</strong>: Expansive soils (like clay) expand when wet and shrink when dry. This constant shifting puts pressure on your foundation, causing cracks and movement.</p>
</li>
 	<li class="" data-start="1035" data-end="1151">
<p class="" data-start="1037" data-end="1151"><strong data-start="1037" data-end="1054">Poor drainage</strong>: If water is allowed to pool around your home, it can weaken the soil and create uneven support.</p>
</li>
 	<li class="" data-start="1152" data-end="1268">
<p class="" data-start="1154" data-end="1268"><strong data-start="1154" data-end="1168">Tree roots</strong>: Large trees planted too close to your home can suck moisture out of the soil, causing it to shift.</p>
</li>
 	<li class="" data-start="1269" data-end="1381">
<p class="" data-start="1271" data-end="1381"><strong data-start="1271" data-end="1289">Plumbing leaks</strong>: Undetected water leaks under your home can erode the soil and lead to foundation settling.</p>
</li>
 	<li class="" data-start="1382" data-end="1507">
<p class="" data-start="1384" data-end="1507"><strong data-start="1384" data-end="1407">Construction issues</strong>: Poor site preparation or subpar construction materials can also cause foundation issues over time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="" data-start="1509" data-end="1548">Warning Signs of Foundation Trouble</h3>
<p class="" data-start="1550" data-end="1683">Recognizing early warning signs can help you catch foundation issues before they become serious. Keep an eye out for these red flags:</p>

<ul data-start="1685" data-end="1925">
 	<li class="" data-start="1685" data-end="1723">
<p class="" data-start="1687" data-end="1723">Cracks in walls, ceilings, or floors</p>

 	<li class="" data-start="1779" data-end="1805">
<p class="" data-start="1781" data-end="1805">Uneven or sloping floors</p>
</li>
 	<li class="" data-start="1806" data-end="1851">
<p class="" data-start="1808" data-end="1851">Gaps between walls and the ceiling or floor</p>

 	<li class="" data-start="1852" data-end="1876">
<p class="" data-start="1854" data-end="1876">Bowed or leaning walls</p>
</li>
 	<li class="" data-start="1877" data-end="1925">
<p class="" data-start="1879" data-end="1925">Water intrusion in the basement or crawl space</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="" data-start="1927" data-end="2049">While a few minor cracks may not be cause for alarm, widespread or worsening damage is usually a sign of a deeper problem.</p>

<h3 class="" data-start="2051" data-end="2082">Types of Foundation Repairs</h3>
<p class="" data-start="2084" data-end="2231">The type of repair needed depends on the extent of the damage and the underlying cause. Here are some of the most common foundation repair methods:</p>

<h4 class="" data-start="2233" data-end="2267">1. <strong data-start="2241" data-end="2267">Piering (Underpinning)</strong></h4>
<p class="" data-start="2268" data-end="2468">Steel or concrete piers are driven into the ground beneath the foundation to lift and stabilize it. This is one of the most effective long-term solutions, especially for homes experiencing settlement.</p>

<h4 class="" data-start="2470" data-end="2506">2. <strong data-start="2478" data-end="2506">Slabjacking (Mudjacking)</strong></h4>
<p class="" data-start="2507" data-end="2670">This method involves injecting a cement-based mixture under a sunken slab to raise it back into place. It's often used for sidewalks, driveways, or concrete slabs.</p>

<h4 class="" data-start="2672" data-end="2696">3. <strong data-start="2680" data-end="2696">Wall Anchors</strong></h4>
<p class="" data-start="2697" data-end="2859">If your foundation walls are bowing or leaning inward due to soil pressure, wall anchors can be installed to pull the walls back into position and stabilize them.</p>

<h4 class="" data-start="2861" data-end="2898">4. <strong data-start="2869" data-end="2898">Sealing and Waterproofing</strong></h4>
<p class="" data-start="2899" data-end="3099">If moisture is the main issue, waterproofing the foundation and improving drainage can prevent further damage. This might include installing French drains, sump pumps, or exterior waterproof coatings.</p>

<p class="" data-start="3253" data-end="3381"><strong data-start="3253" data-end="3292">Keep water away from the foundation</strong>: Ensure your gutters and downspouts direct water at least 5-10 feet away from your home.</p>
</li>

<p class="" data-start="3384" data-end="3500"><strong data-start="3384" data-end="3409">Monitor soil moisture</strong>: During dry spells, water the soil around your home to prevent it from shrinking too much.</p>
